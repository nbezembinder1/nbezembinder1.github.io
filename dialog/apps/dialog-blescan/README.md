# Dialog Semiconductor BLE Scan

This app demonstrates how to scan Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and display the signal strength (RSSI) of found devices.

Bluetooth devices are filter by MAC (device) addresses set in `app.js`. A button is added so users can add extra MAC addresses to this list. This application only works on Android since iOS uses random UUIDs instead of MAC addresses.

This application is based on the [BLE Scan application](https://github.com/evothings/evothings-examples/tree/master/examples/ble-scan).
