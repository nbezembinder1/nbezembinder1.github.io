# Dialog Semiconductor Launchpad

This application (webapp) is meant to be put on a web server, and be opened in a mobile browser. From this page you can launch the Evothings Viewer app, using the `evo:` and `evos:` protocols. The protocols map to `http:` and `https:` respectively.

This can be used on your own web pages, in emails, or to share apps with others.

[Evothings Viewer](https://evothings.com/download/) must be installed on the mobile device for this to work.

The launchpad is already hosted on GitHub pages and can be used to launch several Dialog Semiconductor example applications.

Open the following on your mobile device to open the index application:
