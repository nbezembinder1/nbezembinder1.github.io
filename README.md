## beacons
This application is built using the Evothings Workbench. The app provides a quick demonstration of the DA1458x. 
The Bluetooth device is able to broadcast multiple beacon formats such as Eddystone, iBeacon and AltBeacon. The app detects both Eddystone and iBeacon format. Once the mobile device gets close to the beacon the app will display some information.

The app can be run using the [Evothings Viewer](https://evothings.com/doc/studio/evothings-viewer.html) by either using the [Evothings Workbench](https://evothings.com/doc/tutorials/evothings-studio-getting-started.html) or by opening the link below (must have Evothings Viewer installed).

Since Markdown does not support any URIs other than http, https and ftp you need to manually copy the following link in your browser to open the app in Evothings Viewer
